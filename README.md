# CartoCSS style for printable maps

This is some CartoCSS, usable with [Mapbox
Studio](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-studio), based on the Mapbox
Outdoors style.

I'm trying to emulate an old style from the Ordnance Survey maps,
circa 1960.  I'm using this at around zoom=15, with the intention of
making a printable map of rural roads for bicycling.
