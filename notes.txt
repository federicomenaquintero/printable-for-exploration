** @pitch is too green.  Put in icons of sports?

** Railroad

Make it more visible.

** Motorway

See img/shield/*.png - they need to be redder.  Make the shields have
a black outline?  How to regenerate these from SVG?

** Main roads class=main:

*** type='trunk', type='primary', type='secondary':

Check Ordnance Survey; these have black casing and are red or brown.

Paved roads are yellow with black casing.

Unpaved roads should be white with black casing.

** Streets:

Paved: white with black casing.

Unpaved: white with black casing - how to differentiate from paved
roads?

** Cemetery is perhaps too green; it needs a marker.

** Churches need icon

** Since buildings are black, make POI icons red?
